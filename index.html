                    <p>A computer virus, much like a flu virus, is designed to spread from host to host and has the ability to replicate itself. Similarly, in the same way that flu viruses cannot reproduce without a host cell, computer viruses cannot reproduce and spread without programming such as a file or document.</p>
                    <p>In more technical terms, a computer virus is a type of malicious code or program written to alter the way a computer operates and is designed to spread from one computer to another. A virus operates by inserting or attaching itself to a legitimate program or document that supports macros in order to execute its code. In the process, a virus has the potential to cause unexpected or damaging effects, such as harming the system software by corrupting or destroying data.</p>
                    <h3>Different Types of Computer Virus</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Boot Sector Virus</li>

                    </ol>
                    <h3>How do computer viruses spread?</h3>
                    <p>In a constantly connected world, you can contract a computer virus in many ways, some more obvious than others. Viruses can be spread through email and text message attachments, Internet file downloads, and social media scam links. Your mobile devices and smartphones can become infected with mobile viruses through shady app downloads. Viruses can hide disguised as attachments of socially shareable content such as funny images, greeting cards, or audio and video files.</p>
                    <p>To avoid contact with a virus, it’s important to exercise caution when surfing the web, downloading files, and opening links or attachments. To help stay safe, never download text or email attachments that you’re not expecting, or files from websites you don’t trust.</p>

                <h3>Definition</h3>
                <p>Software that is created specifically to help detect, prevent and remove malware (malicious software).

                </p>
                <p>
                    Antivirus is a kind of software used to prevent, scan, detect and delete viruses from a computer. Once installed, most antivirus software runs automatically in the background to provide real-time protection against virus attacks.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Comprehensive virus protection programs help protect your files and hardware from malware such as worms, Trojan horses and spyware, and may also offer additional protection such as customizable firewalls and website blocking.
                </p>
                <h3>Antivirus programs and computer protection software</h3>
                <p>
                    Antivirus programs and computer protection software are designed to evaluate data such as web pages, files, software and applications to help find and eradicate malware as quickly as possible.


                </p>
                <p>
                    Most provide real-time protection, which can protect your devices from incoming threats; scan your entire computer regularly for known threats and provide automatic updates; and identify, block and delete malicious codes and software.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Because so many activities are now conducted online and new threats emerge continuously, it’s more important than ever to install a protective antivirus program. Fortunately, there are a number of excellent products on the market today to choose from.
                </p>

                <h3>How does antivirus work?</h3>
                <p>Antivirus software begins operating by checking your computer programs and files against a database of known types of malware. Since new viruses are constantly created and distributed by hackers, it will also scan computers for the possibility of new or unknown type of malware threats.

                </p>
                <p>
                    Typically, most programs will use three different detection devices: specific detection, which identifies known malware; generic detection, which looks for known parts or types of malware or patterns that are related by a common codebase; and heuristic detection, which scans for unknown viruses by identifying known suspicious file structures. When the program finds a file that contains a virus, it will usually quarantine it and/or mark it for deletion, making it inaccessible and removing the risk to your device.

                <h2>Computer Worms</h2>
                <h5>Apr 25, 2021</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:400px;width: 800px;"><img src="worms.png" alt="" style="width:800px;height:400px;"></div>
                <p>A computer worm is a type of malware that spreads copies of itself from computer to computer. A worm can replicate itself without any human interaction, and it does not need to attach itself to a software program in order to cause damage.</p>
                <h3>How do computer worms work? </h3>
                <p>
                    Worms can be transmitted via software vulnerabilities. Or computer worms could arrive as attachments in spam emails or instant messages (IMs). Once opened, these files could provide a link to a malicious website or automatically download the computer worm. Once it’s installed, the worm silently goes to work and infects the machine without the user’s knowledge.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Worms can modify and delete files, and they can even inject additional malicious software onto a computer. Sometimes a computer worm’s purpose is only to make copies of itself over and over — depleting system resources, such as hard drive space or bandwidth, by overloading a shared network. In addition to wreaking havoc on a computer’s resources, worms can also steal data, install a backdoor, and allow a hacker to gain control over a computer and its system settings.
                </p>
                <h3>
                    How to tell if your computer has a worm
                </h3>
                <p>If you suspect your devices are infected with a computer worm, run a virus scan immediately. Even if the scan comes up negative, continue to be proactive by following these steps.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>Keep an eye on your hard drive space.</b> When worms repeatedly replicate themselves, they start to use up the free space on your computer.</li>
                    <li><b>Monitor speed and performance.</b> Has your computer seemed a little sluggish lately? Are some of your programs crashing or not running properly? That could be a red flag that a worm is eating up your processing power.</li>
                    <li><b>Be on the lookout for missing or new files.</b> One function of a computer worm is to delete and replace files on a computer.</li>

                <h2>Cyber Security Tools</h2>
                <h5>Apr 24, 2021</h5>
                <div class="fakeimg" style="height:400px;width: 800px;"><img src="cyberSecutiryTools.png" alt="" style="width:800px;height:400px;"></div>
                <p>
                    Protecting our IT environment is very critical. Every organization needs to take cybersecurity very seriously. There are numbers of hacking attacks which affecting businesses of all sizes. Hackers, malware, viruses are some of the real security threats in the virtual world. It is essential that every company is aware of the dangerous security attacks and it is necessary to keep themselves secure. There are many different aspects of the cyber defence may need to be considered. Here are six essential tools and services that every organization needs to consider to ensure their cybersecurity is as strong as possible. They are described below:
                </p>
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Firewalls</h4>
                        <p>As we know, the firewall is the core of security tools, and it becomes one of the most important security tools. Its job is to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network. It can be implemented as hardware, software, or a combination of both. The firewalls are used to prevent unauthorized internet users from accessing private networks connected to the Internet. All messages are entering or leaving the intranet pass through the firewall. The firewall examines each message and blocks those messages that do not meet the specified security criteria.</p>
                        <p>
                            The Firewall is very useful, but it has limitations also. A skilled hacker knew how to create data and programs that are believing like trusted firewalls. It means that we can pass the program through the firewall without any problems. Despite these limitations, firewalls are still very useful in the protection of less sophisticated malicious attacks on our system.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Antivirus Software</h4>
                        <p>
                            Antivirus software is a program which is designed to prevent, detect, and remove viruses and other malware attacks on the individual computer, networks, and IT systems. It also protects our computers and networks from the variety of threats and viruses such as Trojan horses, worms, keyloggers, browser hijackers, rootkits, spyware, botnets, adware, and ransomware. Most antivirus program comes with an auto-update feature and enabling the system to check for new viruses and threats regularly. It provides some additional services such as scanning emails to ensure that they are free from malicious attachments and web links.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>PKI Services</h4>
                        <p>
                            PKI stands for Public Key Infrastructure. This tool supports the distribution and identification of public encryption keys. It enables users and computer systems to securely exchange data over the internet and verify the identity of the other party. We can also exchange sensitive information without PKI, but in that case, there would be no assurance of the authentication of the other party.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            People associate PKI with SSL or TLS. It is the technology which encrypts the server communication and is responsible for HTTPS and padlock that we can see in our browser address bar. PKI solve many numbers of cybersecurity problems and deserves a place in the organization security suite.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Managed Detection and Response Service (MDR)</h4>
                        <p>
                            Today's cybercriminals and hackers used more advanced techniques and software to breach organization security So, there is a necessity for every businesses to be used more powerful forms of defences of cybersecurity. MDR is an advanced security service that provides threat hunting, threat intelligence, security monitoring, incident analysis, and incident response. It is a service that arises from the need for organizations (who has a lack of resources) to be more aware of risks and improve their ability to detect and respond to threats. MDR also uses Artificial Intelligence and machine learning to investigate, auto detect threats, and orchestrate response for faster result.
                        </p>
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <h4>Penetration Testing</h4>
                        <p>
                            Penetration testing, or pen-test, is an important way to evaluate our business's security systems and security of an IT infrastructure by safely trying to exploit vulnerabilities. These vulnerabilities exist in operating systems, services and application, improper configurations or risky end-user behavior. In Penetration testing, cybersecurity professionals will use the same techniques and processes utilized by criminal hackers to check for potential threats and areas of weakness.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            A pen test attempts the kind of attack a business might face from criminal hackers such as password cracking, code injection, and phishing. It involves a simulated real-world attack on a network or application. This tests can be performed by using manual or automated technologies to systematically evaluate servers, web applications, network devices, endpoints, wireless networks, mobile devices and other potential points of vulnerabilities. Once the pen test has successfully taken place, the testers will present us with their findings threats and can help by recommending potential changes to our system.
                        </p>

                    <li>
                        <h4>Staff Training</h4>
                        <p>
                            Staff training is not a 'cybersecurity tool' but ultimately, having knowledgeable employees who understand the cybersecurity which is one of the strongest forms of defence against cyber-attacks. Today's many training tools available that can educate company's staff about the best cybersecurity practices. Every business can organize these training tools to educate their employee who can understand their role in cybersecurity.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            We know that cyber-criminals continue to expand their techniques and level of sophistication to breach businesses security, it has made it essential for organizations to invest in these training tools and services. Failing to do this, they can leave the organization in a position where hackers would be easily targeted their security system. So, the expense of the investment on these training tools might put a reward for the business organization with long-term security and protection.
